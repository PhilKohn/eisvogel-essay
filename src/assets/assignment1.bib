  abstract = {The success of global IT projects is highly influenced by culture-based behaviors. Issues between individuals arise when behaviors are (mis-)perceived, (mis-)interpreted, and (mis-)judged by using the perceiver's expectations, beliefs, and values. Misperception results when the behavior is not anticipated because it would not occur in ones own culture. As a result, behavior should be the starting point for cross-cultural research. But, studies have primarily focused on belief and value systems which are more abstract and less specific than behaviors. This paper presents a study that analyzed cultural behavioral differences between Indian project managers and their counterparts in other countries. The conducted qualitative, semi-structured interviews revealed insights into cross-cultural challenges and shed light on the complex ways that culture-based behaviors impact IT projects. The study identified 127 behaviors that significantly affected project success and cross-cultural cooperation between Indian managers and managers from all over the world. These behaviors were grouped into 19 behavior clusters. Understanding these behavior clusters, and correlating these behaviors to values and beliefs, will improve project collaboration, and inform cross-cultural training strategies. In addition, existing cultural dimensions were reduced in scope, additional dimensions were defined for clarity, and new business-related dimensions were identified. Finally, based on the study's results, the paper suggests four important components that should be added to cross-cultural training programs for international project managers.},

These four positions are referred to here as liberal-individualist, deliberative, counter-publics, and autonomist Marxist. The delineation of each position draws from critical-interpretative research and has been developed with respect to three elements: the democratic subject assumed, the related conception of democracy promoted, and the associated democratic affordances of digital media technology. The aim is to draw attention to different understandings of what extending democracy through digital media means, and to provide a framework for further examination and evaluation of digital democracy rhetoric and practice.},

Unfortunately, this has not significantly enhanced a set of fundamental problems regarding e-government. One of the problems is that the underlying democratic ideology is rarely clearly expressed. In this paper, we have therefore constructed a framework for the analysis of open government from a democratic perspective, to explore the research foundation of open government and the types of research missing. We have looked closely at the notion of democracy in peer-reviewed journals on open government from 2009 to 2013, focusing on discussions of some fundamental issues regarding democracy and the type of solutions suggested. We have found that despite seemingly good intentions and an extensive rhetoric, there is still an apparent lack of adequate tools in which public deliberation and representation are addressed in any meaningful sense. There are two main important observations herein: (i) the rhetoric in the dominant discourse supports the concept of open government formulated by the Obama administration as transparency, participation, and collaboration, but in practice, the focus is predominantly on transparency and information exchange, while ignoring fundamental democratic issues regarding participation and collaboration, and (ii) the concept of the public is inadequately considered as a homogenous entity rather than a diversified group with different interests, preferences, and abilities.},

  abstract = {Recently artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models have demonstrated remarkable progress with applications developed in various domains. It is also increasingly discussed that AI and ML models and applications should be transparent, explainable, and trustworthy. Accordingly, the field of Explainable AI (XAI) is expanding rapidly. XAI holds substantial promise for improving trust and transparency in AI-based systems by explaining how complex models such as the deep neural network (DNN) produces their outcomes. Moreover, many researchers and practitioners consider that using provenance to explain these complex models will help improve transparency in AI-based systems. In this paper, we conduct a systematic literature review of provenance, XAI, and trustworthy AI (TAI) to explain the fundamental concepts and illustrate the potential of using provenance as a medium to help accomplish explainability in AI-based systems. Moreover, we also discuss the patterns of recent developments in this area and offer a vision for research in the near future. We hope this literature review will serve as a starting point for scholars and practitioners interested in learning about essential components of provenance, XAI, and TAI.},

  abstract = {Globalization has been a major phenomenon since the 1980s. As many multinational enterprises (MNEs) grow their presence globally, they have been supported by distributed IT resources that are organized either as centralized IT, decentralized IT, or federated IT. However, despite the significant increase in business complexity in the last decade, there has been relatively little systematic research on new IT organizational forms capable of coping with the sophistication of today's complex (e.g., multi-strategy, multi-product, and multi-geography) MNEs. Drawing from our understanding of the development of organization form in the organization design literature, we examine the applicability of a contemporary organization form, i.e., the multidimensional organization (Ackoff 1999; Galbraith 2009; Strikwerda \& Stoelhorst 2009) to the organizing of IT function in MNEs. Through a revelatory case study of the global IT organization at Siemens, we demonstrate the possibility of a multidimensional design for IT organization in MNEs, where the IT organization is organized into IT Customer-, IT Product-, and IT Resource units. The strategic application of lean and flexible lateral coordination mechanisms enables the multidimensional IT organization to achieve multiple objectives in totality. Implications for research and practices are discussed.},

Digitization measures have positively impacted processes and customer satisfaction in the skilled crafts sector. As the skilled crafts sector is still traditionally positioned, various challenges hinder the transformation. Which barriers stand in the way of digital transformation in the skilled crafts sector - that is the overarching question of our work. In order to find out the barriers, literature research on (general) digitalization barriers was conducted. The identified barriers were divided into organizational and cultural, individual and technical barriers, and missing skills/ workforce. A qualitative study with N=10 experts was conducted to identify the specific barriers for craft enterprises. The results show that most technical, individual barriers and lack of missing skills are reduced through staff training or collaboration.},

  abstract = {A growing literature tries to contribute to a more balanced view of the concept of e-democracy. However, one seldom discussed aspect is the concept's inadequate dimension on what a desirable development of society consists of. By adding certain values, today most pronounced in the theory of social sustainability, this article examines the awareness of such in three e-democratic projects in Swedish municipalities. This is carried out through a qualitative inquiry that uses different types of data and that regards social sustainability as an ongoing process that is suitable to be analysed in relation to other structures in society. The empirical part reveals different important topics. First it shows that the consciousness of socially sustainable values varies between the examined cases. Second, this variation can be due to both the varying success of e-democracy and to conditions inside the political organizations. In conclusion, this paper reveals that the consequence of adding a socially sustainable perspective to e-democracy is that it provides adequate opportunities for analysing social development without missing out qualities that are desired in a democratic society.},

Few studies have realized that the impact of digitalization is not limited to either transaction costs or the location-boundness of firm-specific advantages (FSAs), but extends to profound changes in the fundamental essence of MNEs. There is still limited understanding of this body of knowledge as a whole, including how its subtopics are interrelated. This study took the production factor change perspective to review MNE theory in the digital era. Therefore, this study aims to identify any upcoming and undeveloped themes in order to provide a platform suited to direct future research.},

Over the last decade there has been a gradual awareness of the need to consider the innovative application of ICTs for participation that enables a wider audience to contribute to democratic debate and where contributions themselves are broader and deeper. This awareness has resulted in a number of isolated edemocracy pilots and research studies. It is important to consolidate this work and characterizes the level of participation, the technology used, the stage in the policy-making process and various issues and constraints, including the potential benefits.},

While the unique characteristics of digital technologies and digital assets embody an expansive and promising global landscape for innovation, MNEs' success in pursuing such digital innovation will also be shaped by the nature and extent of localization forces prevalent in different foreign markets, an issue that has received limited attention in both digital innovation and international business literatures. In this short essay, I highlight this gap and call for the study of digital innovation in the international business context by bringing together ideas, theories and concepts from both areas. I draw on and combine two perspectives---one drawn from the innovation literature (digital innovation as recombinant innovation involving digital assets) and the other from the international business literature (the international business context as being defined by national policies and regulations, infrastructure and culture) and suggest several promising themes and questions for future research in this area, specifically relating to how globalization/localization forces facilitate/hinder MNEs' global digital innovation efforts. I hope the call made here will be answered by scholars from both fields and lead to insights that enrich both theory and practice related to MNE innovation in today's rapidly growing digital economy.},

A comparative analysis of the survey responses reveal recognizable differences among managers within and outside India concerning the problems and prospects of ICT as an instrument of global business strategy. Twenty problems that can diminish the influence of ICT in this strategy are identified and classified into four categories: Infrastructure, Regulation and Restrictions, Training and Culture, and Financial Constraints. The study finds that ICT has assisted the bank in maintaining its global competitiveness but the international managers of the bank do not agree that it has generated any competitive advantage. This paper contributes to the field by empirically exploring the prospects of ICT at an incipient global enterprise from an emerging economy.},

  abstract = {Companies expect significant long-term gains in efficiency and productivity through digital transformation (DT). New ways of combining products, processes, and data-driven services, as well as new business models emerge. However, the rapid development of the DT leads to constraints regarding its realization. Barriers hinder companies to realize possible advantages out of DT. If firms promptly recognize potential barriers, they can reflect upon these challenges and can take well-coordinated countermeasures. Social, technical and socio-technical problems address different stakeholder and ask for specific solutions. Therefore, our study aims at developing a taxonomy for barriers to DT to enable researchers and practitioners to identify and classify existing barriers. For deriving the dimensions and characteristics, we collected data by conducting 46 semi-structured interviews with experts and enriched these by looking at the literature on DT barriers.},

  abstract = {Virtual private network (VPN) is a network architecture for virtually extending a private network (i.e. any computer network which is not the public Internet) across one or multiple other networks which are either untrusted (as they are not controlled by the entity aiming to implement the VPN) or need to be isolated (thus making the lower network invisible or not directly usable).  A VPN can extend access to a private network to users who do not have direct access to it, such as an office network allowing secure access from off-site over the Internet.  This is achieved by creating a link between computing devices and computer networks by the use of network tunneling protocols. It is possible to make a VPN secure to use on top of insecure communication medium (such as the public internet) by choosing a tunneling protocol that implements encryption. This kind of VPN implementation has the benefit of reduced costs and greater flexibility, with respect to dedicated communication lines, for remote workers. The term VPN is also used to refer to VPN services which sell access to their own private networks for internet access by connecting their customers using VPN tunneling protocols.},
