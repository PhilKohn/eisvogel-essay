- What is Systems Theory #flashcard 
	- An interdisciplinary framework for understanding and analyzing complex entities composed of interconnected and interdependent components.
	- Focuses on how the components of a system interact with each other and with the external environment, emphasizing the relationships and patterns that emerge from these interactions rather than just the individual elements themselves.
<!--ID: 1725397204175-->


- Key concepts in Systems Theory
	- System: A set of interacting or interdependent  components forming an integrated whole.
	- Subsystems: Smaller systems that are part of a larger system, each having its own function but contributing to the overall system.
	- ﻿﻿Boundary: The distinction between a system and its environment, defining what is inside the system and what is outside.
	- ﻿﻿Inputs and Outputs: Resources (such as information, energy, or material) that enter a system (inputs) and the resulting products or effects that leave the system (outputs).
	- Feedback: The process by which a system self-regulates by using the outputs to influence the inputs, leading to adjustments in behavior.
	- ﻿﻿Equilibrium and Homeostasis: The state of balance within a system where internal variables are regulated to maintain stability.
	- ﻿﻿Emergence: The phenomenon where the whole exhibits properties that its individual components do not have on their own.
	- ﻿﻿Entropy and Negentropy: Systems are subject to entropy, which is the tendency toward disorder. However, systems can also maintain or increase order (negentropy) through self-organization.

- Applications of System Theory
	- Biology: Understanding how different organs and cells work together to sustain life.
	- Engineering: Designing complex systems like transportation networks, computers, or manufacturing processes.
	- Social Sciences: Analyzing societies, organizations, or economies as interconnected systems.
	- Ecology: Studying ecosystems as networks of interacting organisms and their environment.
	- Management: Applying systems thinking to improve organizational effectiveness and solve complex problems.

- Systems Theory to Computer Systems (Relevance to CS)
	- ﻿﻿Systems Theory offers a powerful lens through which computer systems can be understood, analyzed, and designed.
	- ﻿﻿By focusing on the interactions and relationships within the system, rather than just the individual parts, Systems Theory helps create more robust, adaptable, and efficient computer systems.

- Computer Systems
	- ﻿﻿Computer Systems as Complex Systems: A computer system can be viewed as a complex system composed of hardware, software, networking, and user interfaces. Each of these components (subsystems) interacts with others, and together, they form an integrated whole that performs specific tasks.
	- ﻿﻿Subsystem Interactions: In a computer system, subsystems like the operating system, application software, and hardware components must work together harmoniously. Systems Theory helps in understanding how these components communicate, cooperate, and sometimes conflict with each other, leading to system behavior that is often more than the sum of its parts.
	- System Boundaries: Defining the boundary of a computer system is essential for security, usability, and performance. Systems Theory helps in understanding where these boundaries should be set, such as distinguishing between trusted and untrusted zones in a network or deciding what constitutes a failure in system performance.
	- ﻿﻿Holistic Analysis: Systems Theory advocates for a holistic approach to problem-solving and system design. Instead of optimizing individual components in isolation, it encourages considering the system as a whole to understand the impact of each component's behavior on the entire system's performance and stability.

- IMPORTANT: Systems have {INPUT, OUTPUT and FEEDBACK}

- What is science?
	- "Science is the pursuit and application of knowledge and understanding of the natural and social world following a systematic methodology based on evidence."

- Early Foundations (17th-19th Century)
	- Mathematical Beginnings: The roots of computer science can be traced back to mathematical concepts. In the 17th century, the binary number system, fundamental to computer science, was introduced by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz.
	- Analytical Engine: In the 1830s, Charles Babbage designed the Analytical Engine, a mechanical general-purpose computer. Although it was never built in his lifetime, it laid the groundwork for modern computers. Ada Lovelace, who worked with Babbage, is often considered the first computer programmer due to her work on algorithms for the machine.

- The Birth of Modern Computing (1930s - 1940s)
	- Alan Turing and Theoretical Foundations: In 1936, Alan Turing published a paper introducing the concept of a "universal machine" (now known as the Turing Machine), which could simulate the logic of any computation. This was a key development in the theory of computation.
	- First Computers: During World War II, the first electronic computers were developed. The ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer), built in the United States in 1945, was among the first general-purpose electronic computers.
	- Von Neumann Architecture: John von Neumann proposed the stored-program concept in 1945, where a computer's program and the data it processes are stored in the same memory. This architecture remains the foundation of most modern computers.

- Alan Turing
	- Provides a mathematical model for computation and defines the limits of what can be computed.
	- Turing Machine: A theoretical device that manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a set of rules. Despite its simplicity, it can simulate the logic of any computer algorithm.
	- Decidability: The theory helps distinguish between problems that can be solved algorithmically (decidable) and those that cannot (undecidable).
	- Church-Turing Thesis: This hypothesis posits that anything computable by a machine (in the physical sense) is computable by a Turing Machine.
	- Impact: Turing's work laid the foundation for the field of theoretical computer science, influencing areas such as algorithm design, computational complexity, and the development of programming languages.

- Turing Test
	- A test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human.
	- In the test, a human evaluator interacts with both a machine and a human without knowing which is which.
	- ﻿﻿If the evaluator cannot reliably tell the machine from the human based on their responses, the machine is said to have passed the test, demonstrating a form of artificial intelligence. 
	- The Turing Test has become a foundational concept in discussions about Al and machine intelligence.

- The Growth of Computer Science (1950s - 1970s)
	- Programming Languages: The 1950s and 1960s saw the development of the first high-level programming languages, such as FORTRAN (1957) for scientific computing and COBOL (1959) for business applications. Grace Hopper played a crucial role in the development of COBOL.
	- Operating Systems and Software Development: The concept of operating systems emerged in the 1960s, with early systems like UNIX (developed in 1969). This period also saw the formalization of software engineering as a discipline.
	- Artificial Intelligence: The term Artificial Intelligence (AI) was coined in 1956 by John McCarthy, and the field began to take shape with early AI programs that could solve problems and play games like chess.

- The Personal Computer Revolution (1970s - 1980s)
	- Microprocessors and PCs: The invention of the microprocessor in the early 1970s, such as the Intel 4004, led to the development of personal computers (PCs). The Apple II (1977) and the IBM PC (1981) brought computing to homes and small businesses.
	- Networking and the Internet: The development of the ARPANET in the late 1960s, a precursor to the internet, and the introduction of the TCP/IP protocol in the 1980s laid the foundation for the modern internet.

#### Key Take Aways Chapter 1

1. **Historical Evolution of Computing as a Discipline:**
   - Computing has ancient roots, with counting systems and mechanical devices existing for millennia.
   - The modern discipline of computing has no definitive birthdate, but key milestones include developments in the early 1900s in mathematical logic and electrical engineering.
   - Key figures like George Boole (Boolean logic) and Alan Turing (Turing machines and computability) are central to the early development of computer science concepts.

2. **Core Computing Principles:**
   - The chapter highlights fundamental concepts that became central to computing:
     - **Algorithms**: Step-by-step procedures to solve problems.
     - **Stored-Program Concept**: Instructions and data can be stored in the same memory.
     - **Separation of Components**: The division of memory, processing units, control units, and input/output.

3. **Disciplinary Identity and Ongoing Debates:**
   - There is no consensus on what defines computing as a discipline, despite decades of debate.
   - The chapter explores the diverse viewpoints on whether computing is primarily an engineering, mathematical, or scientific discipline.
   - Arguments about computing’s identity focus on its role as a **theoretical field** (similar to mathematics), **an engineering discipline** (focused on practical solutions), or **a science** (focused on empirical data and the study of information processes).

4. **Interdisciplinarity and Complexity of Computing:**
   - Computing draws from multiple fields, including mathematics, electrical engineering, physics, and more recently, social sciences and life sciences.
   - The rapid expansion and diversity of computing applications, such as artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, and scientific computing, make defining the discipline as a whole difficult.
   - The field's interdisciplinarity is both a strength (enabling innovation across sectors) and a challenge (causing fragmentation in defining core methods and objectives).

5. **Major Debates within the Discipline:**
   - There are important debates in computing that still affect how the field is structured and taught:
     - **Theoretical vs. Practical Focus**: Some view computing as an abstract, theoretical discipline, while others emphasize practical engineering applications.
     - **Scientific Nature of Computing**: Whether computing qualifies as a natural or empirical science, especially considering artificial systems.
     - **The Formal Verification Debate**: How much of computing should focus on formal, mathematical proof of correctness versus empirical, experimental methods.

6. **Impacts on Curriculum and Research:**
   - The unresolved debates influence the curriculum in computing, with disagreements over the balance between teaching theory, mathematics, and practical skills.
   - There is also no unified agreement on research methodologies, with differences between the use of formal proofs, empirical experiments, and engineering design methods.

Potential Exam Questions:
   - Discuss the evolution of computing as a discipline and explain why it is difficult to define it as purely mathematical, engineering, or scientific.

For Chapter 2 of *The Science of Computing: Shaping a Discipline*, here are the key takeaways relevant for a master's level exam:

#### Key Take Aways Chapter 2

1. **Hard Core of Theoretical Computing:**
   - Every academic discipline has a "hard core" of theoretical ideas that guide research and provide foundational concepts. In computing, this includes formal definitions of algorithms, computability, and the nature of computation itself.
   - The chapter emphasizes that computing’s theoretical roots date back to foundational work in **mathematical logic** and **symbol systems**.

2. **Leibniz and the Dream of a "Language of Thought":**
   - **Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz** (1646–1716), a polymath, envisioned a symbolic language for reasoning that could represent all human thoughts (the *characteristica universalis*) and a calculus for deriving truths from these symbols (*calculus ratiocinator*).
   - Leibniz’s idea laid early foundations for modern **formal logic** and **symbolic computation**, inspiring later developments in computing.

3. **Boolean Algebra and the Laws of Thought:**
   - **George Boole** (1815–1864) developed **Boolean algebra**, a system of symbolic logic that operates with binary values (true/false). This algebra underpins modern logic circuits and binary computation, essential for digital computing systems.
   - Boole's work is significant for showing how logic can be formalized using algebraic techniques, but it had limitations, particularly with quantifiers like "some" and "all."

4. **Frege’s Formal Logic System:**
   - **Gottlob Frege** (1848–1925) introduced a formal system for reasoning with **quantifiers** and **logical inference**, which is a direct precursor to modern programming languages and the logic used in computing.
   - Frege’s system allowed for rigorous, formal proofs without appealing to intuition, marking an important step in the mechanization of thought, an idea central to computer science.

5. **Hilbert’s Decision Problem (Entscheidungsproblem):**
   - In the late 1800s, **David Hilbert** posed the **decision problem**, asking if there was a mechanical procedure to decide whether a given logical proposition is true or false. Solving this problem became central to formalizing the notion of an algorithm.
   - The decision problem led to critical advancements in the definition of what can be computed (computability).

6. **Kurt Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorems:**
   - **Kurt Gödel** (1906–1978) demonstrated the limits of formal systems in his **incompleteness theorems**. He showed that in any sufficiently powerful system, there are true statements that cannot be proven within that system.
   - Gödel’s work had significant implications for mathematics and computing, proving that some problems cannot be fully solved through formal logic or computation alone.

7. **Turing Machines and Computability:**
   - **Alan Turing** (1912–1954) provided a formal model of computation with his **Turing machine**, a theoretical device that could perform computations by following a set of rules (an algorithm).
   - Turing’s model introduced the idea that a machine could simulate any other machine (the **Universal Turing Machine**), which is foundational to the concept of general-purpose computers.
   - Turing’s work solved the **decision problem** by showing that no algorithm can solve all decision problems (the **halting problem**), meaning there are limits to what can be computed.

8. **Algorithmic Thinking and Formalization:**
   - The development of **formal methods** for defining algorithms and computability was a major step in shaping modern computing. Early work in **mathematical logic**, **algebra**, and **mechanized reasoning** provided the theoretical tools for developing digital computers.
   - The definition of an algorithm as a step-by-step procedure that can be followed without intuition is critical to understanding both the power and limitations of computing.

Potential Exam Questions:
   - Describe Leibniz's vision of a "language of thought" and how it influenced the development of modern computing concepts.
   - Explain George Boole's contributions to symbolic logic and their significance for digital computing.
   - Discuss Gödel’s incompleteness theorems and their implications for computability and the limits of formal systems.
   - What is the **Turing machine**, and how did it provide a formal solution to Hilbert's **decision problem**? Discuss its importance in the development of general-purpose computing.
   - Explain the concept of computability and its formalization in the 20th century. How did Turing and others contribute to this understanding?

Key Concepts for a Master's Level Exam:
1. **Mathematical and Logical Foundations**: Understanding how logic and mathematics form the basis of computing theory.
2. **Algorithm and Computability**: Grasping how algorithms are formalized and the limits of what can be computed.
3. **Historical Development**: Recognizing key historical figures like Leibniz, Boole, Frege, Gödel, and Turing, and their roles in shaping the field of computer science.
4. **Formal Proofs vs. Intuition**: The move from intuitive methods of problem-solving to rigorous formal proofs and their relevance to computer science.
