# Presentation: Software engineering a brief introduction

## ChatGPT o1-preview

Software engineering is a branch of computer science that focuses on applying principles and practices to guide the development of large, complex software systems. It involves a systematic approach to the entire software development lifecycle, including the following key phases:

- **Requirement Engineering**: Defining what the system should do by gathering and analyzing the needs of stakeholders, such as users, business analysts, and managers.

- **Design and Development**: Creating the overall architecture of the system, determining the modules it should consist of, and how these modules will interact.

- **Implementation**: Writing the actual code and building databases to bring the software design to life.

- **Testing and Deployment**: Verifying that the software meets the specified requirements and integrating it into the organization's existing processes and systems.

An important aspect of software engineering is the use of **prototypes**â€”early models of the final system that focus on specific features or functionalities. Prototypes help developers and designers understand potential issues and gather user feedback early in the development process.

**Stakeholder involvement** is crucial throughout the development cycle to ensure the software meets the needs of all parties involved, including users, developers, maintenance personnel, and executives. This collaborative approach increases the likelihood of creating a system that is both effective and user-friendly.

After deployment, software often enters a **maintenance phase**, where it is updated and improved based on user feedback and changing business requirements. Designing software that is easy to maintain is essential, as this phase can be costly and time-consuming.

Software engineering also utilizes various tools to support development, such as:

- **Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)**: Platforms that combine different tools for coding, debugging, and managing software projects.

- **Modeling Tools**: Software like Visio or ArgoUML used for creating graphical representations of the system's design.

- **Model-Driven Development (MDD) Tools**: Tools that generate code and user interfaces from graphical models, sometimes allowing developers to create entire systems without writing code manually.

In summary, software engineering is about applying structured methodologies and tools to efficiently develop software systems that meet the complex needs of users and organizations.

Welcome to this presentation about software engineering. It's actually a brief introduction

to software engineering because many of the presentation and information in this course

is actually part of software engineering. So in this presentation I will just introduce

some basic concepts that could be useful in the course. The question to answer after watching

this presentation is what is software engineering.

We start with the definition from the coursebook.

Software engineering is the branch of computer science that seeks principles to guide the development of large complex software system.

This definition emphasizes the need of principles to guide the software development and the focus is on large complex software system.

There are many sub-disciplines or sub-branches of software engineering, for example, requirement engineering, software and system design and development,

software and system testing,

software and system maintenance.

The two terms, software and systems,

are often used as synonyms.

Sometimes people talk about software design and development,

and other times,

people talk about system design and development.

And I will also use these two terms

as synonyms in this presentation.

An important part of software engineering

is the development of software,

usually called system development or software development.

And it is the creation and construction

of software, of the system,

and it's usually described as a set of phases or activities.

which phases or activities that should be included

in the system development differs from different

organization and in different books.

But usually it's include a phase called

requirement engineering, where you actually define

what system you want to build and how you want

the system to function.

Another important phase is the design phase,

where you actually design the overall architecture

and structure of the system.

What type of module should the system consist of

and how should these modules be related?

The third phase, which is common in system development

process is the implementation phase where you actually code the system and build the

database. Finally, you test and deploy the system, meaning that you test if the system

fulfill the requirement that you have defined in the beginning, and also you introduce the

system in the organization and integrate it with the business processes of the organization

and with other ecosystem that you have. When you talk about system development, you often

need the term prototype. There is no real agreement on what the prototype is, but it

can be seen as an early form of the final system,

where you focus on certain aspects of it.

For example, it could be a drawing on a paper

showing the user interface,

as the picture here on the side,

but it could also be an actual software system,

but with limited functionality,

where you focus on, for example,

performance or security or some other aspects

before you build the final system.

It's very useful to construct a prototype,

because it's an enabler to designer and developers

to better understand what problem you can have

when you start developing the final system.

And it's also a very good tool to get user feedback

early in the development process.

So in many cases, people use the prototype

as the first things to do in the software

and system development process.

Another term that you often meet in software engineering

is stakeholders, and they could be defined as people

or roles that have an interest in the software system

that will be developed.

It could be future users, it could be business analysts,

for example, analysts that gather the requirements

the system and also understand, try to understand how this system actually will support the

business processes of the organization. We also have software developers, the people

that are actually going to construct or code the system. We have IT support and maintenance

personnel that will maintain the system. We have manager, executives and owners which

also have an interest in the system. And it's very important to involve all these stakeholders

in the software development or system development process so they can provide you with your

requirements and also feedback during the development.

This will presidential

Impact during the development. This will increase the possibility to actually create the right system and not the system that people do not want to use.

.

And you see here on the diagram that after that the software has been developed people start using the system and

They often notice that some part doesn't work so well or they are missing important functionality. For example searching for a certain customer

So then what needs to happen is that

The software need to be corrected or updated with new functions and this phase is usually called maintenance and this is a very costly phase

So if you so it's very important when you develop the system that you actually consider the maintenance of the system

Have I really created a system that are easy to maintain?

Because people when they start using the system want additional functionality very often and also the business often change

So you need to adapt your system to the change in the business

And as you can see in this diagram finally you withdraw the system and create a new one

Which will replace the old one. Finally, I will introduce some type of tools that support the software engineering work

Integrated development environment IDE is an environment that combines different kinds of tools for developing a software

It provides a single integrated package to the developers

so the developers for example could have a

Certain part of the system where you actually can find the modules that you want to work on or that you want to check

In other parts of this application or tool you can sort of say do the coding and then in the third part you maybe do the debugging

A very interesting example of an IDE is the so-called Eclipse platform, which is an open source environment

which actually provide a number of plugins to your IDE.

Which means that if you, for example,

want to develop your system using graphical models

as the base or as the beginning,

you can use these plugins.

For example, on the right side here,

you can see that you can start building your system

by introducing some graphical parts and even names

before you then generating the code.

Modeling tools are very popular

when you want to model your system,

graphically. For example, you can use Visio, ArgoUML to do UML modeling, which means that

you actually start drawing graphical models on a high level before you then start coding

the system. Model-driven development tools are tools that support generation of code

and user interface based on these graphical models that I talked about earlier. There

are actually tools which provide you with the possibility to develop the whole system

without writing one line of code. You just use graphical elements and then generate code

from these graphical elements.

The last term is case tool, and these tools are sometimes seen

as predecessors to IDE or MDD tools.

Others see them as a more generic name for IDE and MDD.

So case tools is a term that can have different meanings

for different people.

We are back now to the answer, question to answer

from this presentation.

What is software engineering?

And you can now try to answer that question.
